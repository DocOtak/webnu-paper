\begin{abstract}
  This is just the AGU submitted abstract... fix when done with paper.

  We present a real-time, interactive, web-based visualization of the Earth's antineutrino flux from both natural and man-made sources.
  The initial phase of development displays crust layer thicknesses, surface heat flux due to heat-producing elements, uranium, thorium and potassium, and the surface geo-neutrino flux from these elements in the mantle and crust.
  It permits users to define heat-producing element concentrations in the mantle, including a global constraint on the radiogenic power and the Th/U and K/U ratios of the bulk silicate Earth.
  Moreover, users have various output visualization options for geo-neutrinos, including flux or detectable signal from relevant heat-producing elements.
  The mantle signal is available in several forms as a function of the background from the crust and nuclear reactors.
  Our goal is to implement a tool for education and outreach as well as the research community.
